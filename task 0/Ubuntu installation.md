Well since I did'nt have a CD/Pendrive to burn my osd file I used a virtual box to install Ubuntu as recommended by a Mentor.
So first of all in order to download ubuntu I went to through the offical site of ubuntu (URL- https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop )and i think the size would be like 2-2.9 GB
then I downloaded oracle virtual box 6.1 (URL- https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) though the windows host,platform package.
So I launched the virtual box went to 'new' and set a memory of 50GB , 1GB RAM , version linux  with a oracle 64bit type at a certain device location (preisely at - C:\Users\Administrator\VirtualBox VMs\Ubuntu\Snapshots 
.I created the virtual drive, I went to its settings and set the "drag n drop" and "shared clipboard" as bidirectional. I went to storage option of my virtual platform and imported my dowloaded ubuntu OSD file setup
from the location were it was downloaded, I launched the virtual platform in which there was the setup of obuntu went though the manual setup and the seet the date an time,userid and password
and the operating system was succesfully installed.
